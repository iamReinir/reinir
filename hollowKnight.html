      It's a small indie Metroidvania game make by Team Cherry, pulished in
      2017.

    <aside>
      For the one who don't know what "indie" or" Metroidvania" is, "indie" mean
      independent - the game is developed by individual/small team instead of a
      big studio, and "Metroidvania" is a genre of game that focus on having an
      open world with lots of exploration.

      Our character, the knight, set out into the ruined world of Hallownest.

      Well, I will not provide more information than that. The good part of this
      game is unveiling Hallownest mysteries by yourself. There is very few
      hand-holding in Hollow Knight, to the point that half of your playtime
      will be finding your way. And look how big the map is!

      The map the game give you is not very helpful. But to be honest,
      constantly getting lost is the best part of this game. The world is so
      detailed that getting lost usually means you would find something
      interesting in a corner of the world.
