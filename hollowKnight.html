      <p>
        For the one who don't know what "indie" or" Metroidvania" is, "indie"
        mean independent - the game is developed by individual/small team
        instead of a big studio, and "Metroidvania" is a genre of game that
        focus on having an open world with lots of exploration.

        Well, I will not provide more information than that. The good part of
        this game is unveiling Hallownest mysteries by yourself. There is very
        few hand-holding in Hollow Knight, to the point that half of your
        playtime will be finding your way. And look how big the map is!

        />
      </a>
      <p>
        The map the game give you is not very helpful. But to be honest,
        constantly getting lost is the best part of this game. The world is so
        detailed that getting lost usually means you would find something
        interesting in a corner of the world.
